# Rapid7 Rails Dollhouse Repository

This repository contains what are so called "dollhouses",
representing what a Ruby on Rails application is supposed to look like when created from scratch.

This helps developers in finding difference between the various versions of Ruby on Rails,
as well as compare the state of an application against a fresh installation.

## Current Dollhouse configurations

* [Ruby on Rails 7.0.8.4](./rails-7.0.8.4) : A vanilla Ruby on Rails 7.0.8.4 setup.
* [Ruby on Rails 7.0.8.4 - RSpec](./rails-7.0.8.4-rspec) : Ruby on Rails 7.0.8.4 with RSpec configured
